## Criteria to Assess
This question is designed to evaluate the following criteria:
{criteria_list}

## Candidate's Answer
{answer}

## Your Task

Evaluate the answer and determine:

1. **criteria_assessed**: For EACH criterion listed above, determine:
   - **demonstrated**: Was this criterion clearly demonstrated in the answer? (true/false)
   - **evidence**: If demonstrated, quote or summarize the specific part of the answer that shows it

2. **answer_quality** (1-5): Overall quality of the answer, BASED PRIMARILY ON HOW MANY CRITERIA ARE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED AND HOW STRONGLY THEY ARE SUPPORTED.
   - 1: No criteria demonstrated
   - 2: Less than half criteria weakly or vaguely demonstrated
   - 3: At least more than half criteria list clearly demonstrated, others missing or vague
   - 4: Most criteria clearly demonstrated with concrete evidence
   - 5: All criteria clearly demonstrated with strong, specific evidence

### Scoring Rules
- If a criterion is marked **demonstrated: true**, it MUST positively impact the quality score.
- If most or all criteria are demonstrated, the quality score should NOT be below 4.
- Do NOT give a high quality score if criteria are missing, even if the answer is well-written.

3. **reasoning**
Now generate reasoning feedback directed to the candidate.

The feedback must:
- Be written in a supportive and professional coaching tone.
- Avoid mentioning "criteria," "scoring rules," or internal evaluation structure.
- Clearly explain: What they did well, What was missing or weak, How they can improve their answer next time
- Be specific and actionable.
- Do NOT reference rubric mechanics (e.g., "second criterion").
- Be concise (1–2 lines).
- The "reasoning" field must be a plain string, not an object.

Be fair but strict. Prioritize factual, explicit evidence over general or abstract statements.
