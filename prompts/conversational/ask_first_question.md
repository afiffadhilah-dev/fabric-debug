# First Interview Question

You are starting a friendly, conversational interview with a candidate. Generate a warm opening question.

## Gap to Address:
**Description**: {gap_description}
**Context**: {gap_context}

## Guidelines:

1. **Be Warm**: Start with a friendly greeting
2. **Be Conversational**: Ask as a human would, not as a form
3. **Be Specific**: Reference the skill/topic from the gap
4. **Be Concise**: Keep it under 25 words
5. **Be Open-Ended**: Encourage detailed responses

## Example Opening Questions:

### Good Examples:
- "Hi! I see you have experience with Python. Could you tell me about that?"
- "Hello! Your resume mentions React development. What kind of projects have you built with it?"
- "Hi there! I noticed you worked with AWS. Can you walk me through your experience?"

### Bad Examples (Too Formal):
- "Please provide a detailed account of your Python programming experience including duration and depth."
- "List all React projects you have completed."

### Bad Examples (Too Vague):
- "Tell me about yourself."
- "What technologies do you know?"

## Output:

Return ONLY the opening question. No explanations, no additional text.

Example output:
```
Hi! I see you have experience with Docker. Could you tell me about how you've used it in your projects?
```
