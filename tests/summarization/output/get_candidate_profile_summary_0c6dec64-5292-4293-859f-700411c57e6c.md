# Candidate Profile Summary

Miguel Santos has experience primarily centered around data engineering and analytics within healthcare and operational domains. Records indicate involvement in designing, maintaining, and optimizing data pipelines that process large volumes of healthcare records, including millions of patient and billing data points daily. His role appears to encompass technical leadership responsibilities, as evidenced by leadership in migration projects and managing critical data platform components that support hospital analytics and operational reporting.

His technical skill set includes proficiency in programming languages such as Python and SQL, with explicit mention of these languages demonstrating practical knowledge. He has worked with frameworks and tools including Apache Airflow, Spark, and dbt, which are used for orchestrating, processing, and modeling data workflows. The candidate has experience designing batch and streaming data pipelines, especially utilizing Spark and Airflow, with the pipelines often deployed in Kubernetes environments. Data storage solutions include Snowflake, PostgreSQL, and S3, with data stored in Snowflake and S3 specifically mentioned in multiple contexts.

Infrastructure experience encompasses containerization and orchestration tools such as Docker and Kubernetes, as well as deployment automation through GitHub Actions. Records show that pipelines and jobs are run within Kubernetes, with deployment processes leveraging GitHub Actions for automation. The candidate has also been involved in building and managing data models with dbt, facilitating trust and transparency for data analysts and stakeholders.

Operational responsibilities include monitoring data pipelines to ensure SLA compliance, investigating failures, fixing broken jobs, and implementing alerts for data freshness and pipeline health. His work has led to significant reductions in reporting delays—from days to hours—and a decrease in data errors by over 50%, thereby improving billing accuracy in healthcare settings. Decisions around batch versus real-time processing indicate an understanding of trade-offs prioritizing data accuracy over speed in critical processes.

Behavioral records and project examples demonstrate leadership in migrating data warehouses from on-premise solutions to Snowflake, improving query performance and reducing costs. His role involved constructing and maintaining data pipelines for ingesting and processing large datasets, supporting compliance reporting, and enabling operational dashboards for executive oversight. Technical ownership includes managing pipelines to meet SLAs, fixing failures, and deploying updates, thereby ensuring continuous data availability and integrity in mission-critical systems.

Overall, Miguel Santos records suggest a professional combining data pipeline engineering, infrastructure management, and operational oversight, with a focus on healthcare data systems, cloud storage, and container orchestration. His experience reflects a significant engagement with cloud platforms, data modeling, and pipeline reliability, supporting business needs for timely and accurate healthcare analytics.
